# Wikipedia-to-WordCloud-
I love finding new python packages to explore, and seeing how to integrate them into different workflows. I don't find WordClouds to be inherently useful in decision making, except to elicit a qualitative response, this was just a quick proof of concept that I will expand into more quantitative metrics in the next few weeks. 

So if you have a burning desire to create and print a wordcloud .png directly from a wikipedia article, about the noble sport of Chess-Boxing enjoy. 

##Data Extraction

 Please get hold of me if have any questions or queries. 
 
 Thanks!
